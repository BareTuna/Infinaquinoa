### Infinaquinoa, A Monochrome Game in MonoGame

I want this game to be an infinite, black and white pixely game about riding on a train.

I'm not sure I'm going to be able to accomplish the train part, but I still want to at least make an infinite walking simulator.

~~If I finish in time, I'll submit it for [this itch.io game jam.](https://itch.io/jam/small-and-infinite)~~ Game jam passed. Just for fun now :P
